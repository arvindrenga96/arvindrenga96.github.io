I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science & Engineering at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Vipin Kumar.
I am interested in Machine learning solutions for complex scientific systems in the presence of noisy, incomplete, and unknown data.



Background
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
