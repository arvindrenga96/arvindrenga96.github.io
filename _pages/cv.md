* B.S. in Computer Science, BITS Pilani, 2019
* M.S. in Physics, BITS Pilani, 2019
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Minnesota, 2022(expected)
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of Minnesota, 2026(expected)

Work experience
======
* Summer 2021 to Present: Graduate Research Assistant
  * University of Minnesota
  * Working on developing machine learning solutions for complex scientific systems in the presence of noisy, incomplete, and unknown data.
  * Supervisor: Professor Vipin Kumar

* Spring 2019: Software Development Engineer Intern
  * Amazon, Device Master Service Team.
  * OMA To PCE Migration: Assisted with Migration from OMA to PCE, by identifying, designing and developing replacement for OMA APIs for fetching order Details. The replacements and changes for the migrations were implemented in Java on Machine learning for Detection and Classification of potentially
habitable Exoplanets.
  * Xfsn Cookie Migration: Responsible for migrating all services in team which used X-Fsn cookie library to a newer version of the the same. X-Fsn cookies is used to identify and authenticate requests from Amazon old generation devices.
  * Operational excellence and Service Enhancement :
Actively involved in monitoring servers, assisted with root cause analysis, communicated options for resolution, provided recommendation and resolved the same by taking ownership of selected services.
